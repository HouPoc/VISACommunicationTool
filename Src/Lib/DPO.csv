NOTE. Curve data is transferred from the oscilloscope asynchronously, depending
on the length of the curve record. Such transfers may require several seconds
to complete. During this period, the oscilloscope will not respond to the user
controls. You can interrupt these asynchronous data transfers by sending a device
clear message to the oscilloscope or by interrupting the query with another
command or query. In order to verify that curve data has been completely
transferred, it is recommended that you follow such queries with an *ESR?
query to verify there are no error bits set. You can also check the event queue to
determine the cause of the error, if any. If the error was caused by an interrupted
query, then the asynchronous data transfer was not complete when the *ESR?
query was sent. In such cases, it may be necessary to increase the program's
time-out value to ensure that all data is transferred and read.
","The CURVe command transfers the waveform data points to the oscilloscope’s
internal reference memory location (REF1–4), which is specified by the
DATa:DESTination command. The CURVe? query transfers data from the
oscilloscope; the source waveform is specified by the DATa:SOUrce command.
The first and last data points are specified by the DATa:STARt and DATa:STOP
commands.
Associated with each waveform transferred using the CURVe command or query
is a waveform preamble that provides the data format, scale and associated
information needed to interpret the waveform data points. The preamble
information for waveforms sent to the oscilloscope is specified using the
WFMInpre commands. The preamble information for waveforms transferred from
the oscilloscope is specified or queried using the WFMOutpre commands. If the
waveform is not displayed, the query form generates an error.
The CURVe command and CURVe? query transfer waveform data in ASCII or
binary format. ASCII data is sent as a comma-separated list of decimal values.
Binary data is sent with the IEEE488.2 binary block header immediately followed
by the binary data. The IEEE488.2 binary block header is defined as follows:
#N<N-digits>
where: N is a single decimal or hexadecimal digit indicating the number of digits
to follow. <N-digits> are the decimal digits representing the number of bytes in
the data that immediately follows this binary block header.
The Waveform Transfer command group text contains more comprehensive
information. (See page 2-93, Waveform Transfer Command Group.)
(See page D-1, Waveform Transfer (WFMOutpre and CURVe Query) Examples.)
NOTE. In order to guarantee that the waveform data returned from CURVE?
queries of multiple waveforms are correlated to the same acquisition, you
should use single sequence acquisition mode to acquire the waveform data
from a single acquisition. Single sequence acquisition mode is enabled using
ACQuire:STOPAfter SEQuence.

Display,MESSage:SHOW <QString>,MESSage:SHOW?,,,"<QString> is the message and can include any of the characters shown in
the Character Set. (See page A-1, Character Set.)The maximum length of the
message is 1000 characters; the instrument ignores longer strings.
The message box size is set to fit the message. You can also set the message area
height and width using the MESSage:BOX command. The length of the message
that fits in the message area depends on the contents of the message because
the width of characters varies.
If the message exceeds the limits of the message box, either horizontally or
vertically, the portion of the message that exceeds the limits will not be displayed.
The message string itself is not altered. The entire message can be returned as a
query response regardless of what is displayed in the message box.
The message is left-justified, and is displayed on a single line starting with the
top most line in the window. A new line character can be embedded in the string
to position the message on multiple lines. You can also use white space and tab
characters to position the message within a line. Text which does not fit within
the message box is truncated. Defining a message box text string erases any
previously displayed text within the message box.
You can send a tab by transmitting a tab character (\t or \x09) followed characters
representing the most significant eight bits followed by significant eight bits of a
16-bit number. The number specifies the position relative to the left margin of
the message area. For example, to tab send TAB (\t or \x09), NUL (decimal 0),
and CR (decimal 13).
For example, using hexadecimal escape sequences, MESSAGE:SHOW
’\x09\x01\x17Hello’ when sent as a command would cause the ’Hello’ to be
displayed starting at pixel position 279 relative to the left margin set by the
MESSAGE:BOX command. If you want to display characters starting at position
279, then 279 = 0x0117; split the hexadecimal number into two characters 0x01
and 0x17 and send \x09\x01\x17.
Special characters which control decoration are two character sequences where the
first character is an escape (0x1b) and the second character is as described below.
Bit 7 0
Bit 6 If set, inverse video is toggled from current state and the following text
is displayed in the new inverse state until the state is toggled again.
Remaining bits are ignored
Bit 5 If set, the color index in the four LSB’s (bits 0 through 3) is applied to
the foreground or background color depending on the fg/bg bit (bit 4).
Bit 4 If set, color change is applied to the background, otherwise applies to
the foreground.
Bit 0 – 3 Specifies the color index (0 through 15) to change color as specified
below:
Index 0 Black (transparent)
Index 1 Yellow (Ch 1)
Index 2 Cyan (Ch 2)
Index 3 Magenta (Ch 3)
Index 4 Green (Ch 4)
Index 5 Red (math)
Index 6 White (reference)
Index 7 Orange
Index 8 Black
Index 9 Black
Index 10 Blue
Index 11 Dark Green
Index 12 Tan
Index 13 Black
Index 14 White (text color)
Index 15 Dark gray
Bit 4 If set, the foreground color is set to the default foreground color.
Bit 3 If set, the background color is set to the default background color.
Bit 2 Undefined
Bit 1 Undefined
Bit 0 Undefined
The ESC (escape) character followed by the @ character turns inverse video on or
off and can be embedded in the message string. Example: “abcESC@defESC@
ghi” specifies the string “abcdefghi” where the “def” portion is displayed in
inverse video.
Example: “abcESC#defESC)ESC@ghi” specifies the string “abcdefghi” where
the “def” portion appears in the channel 3 color (magenta) and the “ghi” portion
appears in the normal text color except it’s in inverse video.
An alternate way to enter characters is octal escape sequences. This consists of a
backslash followed by numerals in the standard C language printf fashion.
Another way to enter characters is \xnn where the nn is the hexadecimal value of
the character to display.
An advantage of these methods is that any controller program can be used.
Another advantage is it’s easy to access characters with the high bit set, that is,
those characters with a decimal value greater than 127.
An alternate way to enter certain characters is with a backslash followed by a
single character (following “standard” Unix) as described in the table below.
n Newline (carriage return and line feed)
\ Backslash (\\ is required to get a backslash character)
t Horizontal tab; the next 2 characters specify the pixel column to tab to
as explained earlier
If a backslash is followed by an undefined special character, the backslash is
ignored and the character following it is accepted as is.
NOTE. The use of any escape codes other than those described above may
produce unpredictable results.
","MESSage:SHOW “Hello World”
displays “Hello world” in the upper left corner of the box (you can define the box
size with the MESSAGE BOX command).
MESSage:SHOW “@Hello World@ .. hello”
displays “Hello world .. hello” in the upper left corner of the box and the word
“world” is displayed in inverse video. In this example,  stands for the escape
character. The escape character may appear differently for you depending on
your controller program.
","This command specifies the contents of the message box. MESSage:SHOW
<Qstring> defines the content of the message box. Change in string length causes
automatic resize of the message box to fit the text. The box may be resized using

or an MDO3PWR application module for MDO3000 series models.
","NONe Use to set the measurement type to None.
QUALity Use the power quality functions to obtain measurements and statistics
about the general power quality in your test circuit
SWITCHingloss Use the switching loss functions to obtain the power loss and
energy loss across the acquired waveform, including turn-on loss, turn-off loss,
conduction loss, and total loss. Typically, use these functions to characterize
losses in power supply switching devices, as they switch on and off.
SOA Use the safe operating functions to obtain an X-Y display of the switching
device-under-test's voltage and current. Also use them to perform a mask test of
the X-Y signal relative to the graphical X-Y description of the device specification
table. The safe operating area is typically the voltage and current values that a
semiconductor can operate without damaging itself.
HARMonics Use the harmonics functions to obtain the frequency spectrum of the
source waveform and associated measurement values. Harmonic measurements
can help one perform in-depth troubleshooting of power quality problems.
RIPPle Use the ripple functions to obtain measurements and statistics for the
AC components of the acquired waveform. Ripples are often found on top of a
large DC signal.
MODULationanalysis Use the modulation functions to obtain a trend plot of a
measurement value across the acquired waveform. This is useful for showing the
variations in the modulated switching signal.
DESKew Run the deskew procedure to match the delays through the probes.
Different probes introduce different delays between the probe tip and the
oscilloscope. Many oscilloscope users do not have to worry about this because
they use the same type of probe on all channels. Power measurement users,
however, frequently use both a voltage probe and a current probe. A current
probe typically has a larger delay than a voltage probe, so setting deskew values
becomes important.
